## Bio

I’m currently a student at Columbia University, studying Operations Research with a concentration in Financial Engineering, and I’m also part of the 3+2 Engineering Program with Simmons University, where I recently completed a B.S. in Financial Mathematics. My journey through quantitative finance has been driven by a love of problem-solving, data analysis, and building models that turn complex information into actionable insights.

Over the past few years, I’ve explored these interests through internships in portfolio analytics, sales & trading, and quantitative trading, where I’ve applied coding, modeling, and analytical skills to real-world financial data. Beyond technical work, I’m deeply passionate about mentorship and advancing women in quantitative finance - founding Columbia Lioness Quantitative to create hands-on workshops, speaker events, and industry networking opportunities has been one of the most rewarding experiences!

Outside of work and academics, I’m endlessly curious about the world: I love reading about economics, exploring markets, and testing my strategic thinking in chess and poker. I also enjoy staying active through volleyball and sailing, and I’ve earned certifications as a sailboat handler and chess tournament director.
I created this website as a space to share my projects, experiences, and ideas, and I hope it gives a sense of both my professional journey and the curiosity and creativity that drive me every day.
